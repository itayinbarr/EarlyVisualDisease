# EarlyVisualAttention Model

The EarlyVisualAttention model is a Python-based framework designed to simulate and study the impact of various visual pathologies on attention mechanisms by manipulating model parameters. This model allows for comparisons with established visual attention models and supports extensive image-based experiments to explore different pathological states.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main model classes and scripts.
  - `BaseVisualAttention.py`: Defines the base visual attention model.
  - `VisualAttentionDefinitions.py`: Sets parameters and constants for the model.
  - `ExperimentRunner.py`: Manages the running and documentation of experiments.

- `data/`: Houses control and pathological images for experiments.
  - `HealthyImages/`: Control images for healthy state comparisons.
  - `PathologicalImages/`: Images simulating different diseases.

- `experiments/`: Scripts and settings for disease-specific experiments.

- `results/`: Stores experimental outcomes, organized by disease and weight types.

- `demos/`: Demonstration scripts for model application.

- `tests/`: Contains model comparison and unit tests.
